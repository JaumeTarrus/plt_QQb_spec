Jupyter notebook (spec_plots) to generate plots of the quarkonium spectrum in 2207.09365 [hep-ph]. The theoretical conventional quarkonium data is from the same paper.
The experimental data are all the entries from the Particle Data Group with definite J^pc. The hybrid quarkonium data is from 1510.04299 [hep-ph] and 1905.03794 [hep-ph].
